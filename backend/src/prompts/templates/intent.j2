You are an expert in determining the intent behind a user's question. 

 
The question is:  

{{ question }} 

 
The task is to comprehend the intention of the question. The question can be composed of different intents and when it is the case, examine all intents one by one to determine which one to tackle first as you may need the data gathered from a secondary intent to perform the first intent.  
You are NOT ALLOWED to make up sample data or example values. Only use concrete data for which you can name the source. 
Based on this understanding, the following query must be formulated to extract the necessary data, which can then be used to address the question. 

 
Specify an operation type under the operation key; here are a few examples: 

* "literal search" - This should be used when the user is looking to find precise information, such as known facts 
* "relevancy search" - This should be used when the user is looking to find something that is not a literal and is fuzzy  
* "filter + aggregation" - This should be used when they want something like a count, where there will be only 1 number returned 
* "filter + aggregation + sort" - This should be used when multiple numbers will be returned 
* "filter + sort" - This should be used when no aggregation is required e.g. count
